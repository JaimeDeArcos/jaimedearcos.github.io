> Developing microservices can provide significant advantages such as scalability, flexibility, and rapid deployment. However, the journey to a microservice architecture is filled with potential pitfalls. In this post, we'll explore 5 common mistakes to avoid when developing microservices.

## 1. Highly Coupled Services

One common mistake is creating tightly coupled microservices, which undermines independence and complicates deployment and updates.

**Example**: Using a shared library across multiple microservices might initially seem efficient. However, when the library evolves, every microservice depending on it must be updated and redeployed simultaneously, resulting in complex coordination and loss of service independence.

## 2. Ignoring Error Handling and Resilience

Failures are inevitable in distributed architectures. A frequent error is neglecting robust error handling, automatic retries, circuit breakers, or fallback patterns. Resilience is crucial to preventing cascading failures.

**Example**: If a critical payment microservice fails without proper resilience measures, it could halt the entire purchasing flow, negatively impacting user experience and causing economic losses.

## 3. Inadequate Monitoring

Visibility is crucial in distributed systems. Without a clear monitoring and observability strategy (centralized logs, metrics, and distributed tracing), it's difficult to detect problems early or perform effective diagnostics.

**Example**: A performance degradation in one microservice without centralized metrics and tracing could lead to hours wasted trying to pinpoint the specific service causing the bottleneck.

## 4. Deploying Microservices Without Automation

Rapid and flexible deployment is a significant advantage of microservices, but many teams mistakenly fail to automate these processes early, leading to human errors, inconsistent configurations, and scalability issues. Prioritizing automation with CI/CD is essential.

**Example**: Repeated manual deployments can lead to frequent human errors, such as incorrect configurations that cause hard-to-detect production issues.

## 5. Overly Fragmented Microservices

Excessively splitting an application into very small microservices can create more problems than it solves. Microservices should align clearly with business domains and values, avoiding excessive fragmentation that complicates management and operation.

**Example**: Creating separate microservices for every minor function, such as managing a simple form or validating an input, can result in significant operational overhead with minimal scalability or performance benefits.
